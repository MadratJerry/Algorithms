_1.4.22_ **Binary search with only addition and subtraction.** [Mihai Patrascu](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mip/probs.html) Write a program that, given an array of N distinct int values in ascending order, determines whether a given integer is in the array. You may use only additions and subtractions and a constant amount of extra memory. The running time of your program should be proportional to log N in the worst case.

Solution: [FibonacciSearch](FibonacciSearch.java)
